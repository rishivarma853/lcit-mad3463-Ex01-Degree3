# Exercise 1-2 : Degree3.java

Write a small Java program, Degree3.java, allowing you to evaluate a 3rd degree polynomial of the form:
((a+b)/2)*x^3 + (a+b)^2*x^2 + a + b + c

Execution example:
Enter a (int) : 1
Enter b (int) : 2
Enter c (int) : 3
Enter x (double) : 3.5
The value of polynomial is 180.5625

* Note that there is no single operator for Power 3 in Java. It is necessary to use multiplications. You will also introduce auxiliary variables as needed to make the calculation more efficient. Do not forget to make sure that the class name is the same as the file name
